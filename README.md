# Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to give you an intuition for the various distributions we covered in class. 

Since you will be asked to include figures you will see **true/false** questions in the canvas quiz. This will allow me to grade/comment on the individual questions. 

# Uniform distribution

Create a datatset drawn from a uniform distribution with 10,000 samples taken between the values of 4 and 6

## Question 1

Visualize that distribution with a histogram 



# Binomial Distribution 

If two mice who are carriers for albinism (but not albino themselves) mate, their offspring have a 1/4 probability of being albino. Based on this information conduct the following analyses

## Question 2

What is the probability that exactly 2 offspring in a litter of 10 are albino?

## Question 3

Plot the probability distribution function for albinism in a litter of 10 mice.

## Question 4

What is the probability that there are 8 or more albino mice in a litter of 10 mice?

## Question 5

What is the probability of at least 3 but no more than 5 albino mice in a litter of 10


# Multinomial Distribution 

Recall our Dihybrid cross in birds
